# Exclusive Restaurant

Exclusive Restaurant is a web application that allows users to make restaurant bookings. It is built using various technologies and frameworks and deployed using Heroku, Cloudinary and ElephantSQL. Here is a link to the deployed website. \
**Note:** This booking system would not be a whole restaurants website but only the booking system feature for one. This app has full functionality for authentication and creating bookings but is only a basic app and should be included in and styled to suit a full restaurant website.
